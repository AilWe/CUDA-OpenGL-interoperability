# This is a CUDA/OpenGL interoperability project


## introduction

OpenGL is a graphics library with a wide range of APIs to render 2D and 3D graphics 
on the screen. It provides more than 200 functions for easily rendering vector graphics
on GPU, including primitive function, attribute functions, viewing functions, input 
functions, and control functions. CUDA is a parallel computing platform. It enables 
software developers to use GPU efficiently. CUDA-OpenGL Interoperability enables
the calculation of OpenGL can be done in parallel to achieve better performance. Even 
it is possible to finish all visualization without leaving GPU. 
## Implementation

Julia set is a set of complex numbers. The Julia set consists of values in which a small 
perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values [4]. 
The family of complex quadratic gives a very popular complex dynamical system. The 
Julia set can be expressed as the function
`f(z) = z^2 +c`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
